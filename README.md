# Project Cardinal (Slices 1–3)

This repo is a deterministic headless Node.js simulation inspired by “governed” agent systems.

## What’s included
- Slice 1: sim kernel (tick loop, event log, metrics, deterministic RNG)
- Slice 2: basic NPCs (needs + traits)
- Slice 3: mechanized fear + bounded-rational action selection (softmax)

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run sim
